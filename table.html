        The Baganda, in whose territory this British settlement was located, then translated "Hill of the
        Impala" as Akasozi ke'Empala. This was then shortened to K'empala and finally Kampala. Kasozi means

        initial British colonial settlement that would later on spread out from the occupied Old Kampala hill

            In my younger and more vulnerable years
            my father gave me some advice that I've
            been turning over in my mind ever since.
            'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me,
            'just remember that all the people in this world
            haven't had the advantages that you've had.'Forests form distinctly different biomes at different latitudes
            and elevations, and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration rates.[9] These biomes include
            boreal forests in subarctic climates, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator,
            and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Forests form in areas of the Earth with high rainfall, while
            drier conditions produce a transition to savanna. However, in areas with intermediate rainfall levels,
            forest transitions to savanna rapidly when the percentage of land that is covered by trees drops below 40 to
            45 percent.[10] Research conducted in the Amazon rainforest shows that trees can alter rainfall rates across
            a region, releasing water from their leaves in anticipation of seasonal rains to trigger the wet season
            early. Because of this, seasonal rainfall in the Amazon begins two to three months earlier than the climate
            would otherwise allow.[11][12] Deforestation in the Amazon and anthropogenic climate change hold the
            potential to interfere with this process, causing the forest to pass a threshold where it transitions into
            savanna.[13]

            Deforestation threatens many forest ecosystems. Deforestation occurs when humans remove trees from a
            forested area by cutting or burning, either to harvest timber or to make way for farming. Most deforestation
            today occurs in tropical forests. The vast majority of this deforestation is because of the production of
            four commodities: wood, beef, soy, and palm oil.[14] Over the past 2,000 years, the area of land covered by
            forest in Europe has been reduced from 80% to 34%. Large areas of forest have also been cleared in China and
            in the eastern United States,[15] in which only 0.1% of land was left undisturbed.[16] Almost half of
            Earth's forest area (49 percent) is relatively intact, while 9 percent is found in fragments with little or
            no connectivity. Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas
            subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. Roughly 80 percent of
            the world's forest area is found in patches larger than 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres). The
            remaining 20 percent is located in more than 34 million patches around the world – the vast majority less
            than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in size.[8]
