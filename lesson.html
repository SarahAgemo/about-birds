                The official language is English, although the Constitution states that "any other language may be used
                as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative,
                administrative, or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law." Luganda, a central region-based
                language, is widely spoken across the Central and South Eastern regions of the country, and several
                other languages are also spoken including Ateso, Lango, Acholi, Runyoro, Runyankole, Rukiga, Luo,
                Rutooro, Samia, Jopadhola, and Lusoga. In 2005 Swahili, which is foreign and so viewed as being neutral,
                was proposed as Uganda's second official language, but this has yet to be ratified by parliament.
                However, in 2022 Uganda decided to make Swahili a mandatory subject in the school curriculum.
